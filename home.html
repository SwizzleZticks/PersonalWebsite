            <h2>Blogging</h2>
            <p>I don't ever really blog so don't look here for updates, nor do I or will I ever have any interest in blogging. But since Grand Circus is requiring me to do this, I will use this funny paragraph as filler material for the time being. Who knows I may end up wanting to actually blog eventually, just kidding that is a lie.</p>

            <h2>Developing</h2>
            <p>Now this is a section I can get down with, I am a full stack developer and I specialize in building web applications using C#, Java, JavaScript/Typescript, HTML/CSS, Angular, SQL Server. I really enjoy problem solving and learning new stuff in the related field. Currently I am learning GO in my freetime in hopes to work with my best friend Felipe at SoftServe.</p>
